This is my portfolio made in ReactJS.

Check this out: www.bartek-benedyczak.pl

This is my second ReactJs project. It was fun to learn and work with CSS modules with SCSS. Now I know how usefull is SCSS, I don't have to work with webkits anymore, that's really powerfull tool. Design in Figma took my long time, I see big room to ipmrove there. I encountered plenty of bugs, mainly with mobile devices such as problme with disapearing tool bars or landscape mode in Safari.

I'm glad of my third own project.

To run this project on your computer fetch code and run npm install and npm start.

Greetings Bartek
